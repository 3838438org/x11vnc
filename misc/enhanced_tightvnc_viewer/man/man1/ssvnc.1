.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ssvnc
is a tcl/tk gui wrapper that runs on Unix, MacOSX, and Windows.
It sets up an SSL or SSH tunnel to the remote VNC Server and then launches
the VNC viewer (either the one provided or another one that you have
specified) to use that encrypted tunnel to connect to the VNC Server.
The use of Proxies and Gateways to make the connections is implemented. 

Once you have started the SSVNC gui, you can click on the buttons
"Help", "Options -> Help", "Certs -> Help", etc. for much information
on how to use and configure the tool.

In short, you supply a VNC server "hostname:display" in the
"VNC Host:Display" entry box and then press the "Connect" button to
connect to the server via SSL (stunnel).  E.g. "far-away.east:0".
Port numbers are also allowed, e.g. far-away.east:5905.

Or supply user@hostname:display and click on the "Use SSH" option, then
press the "Connect" button to connect to the server via an SSH tunnel.
E.g. "fred@far-away.east:0".

As an easter egg, we note it is also possible to disable the use of SSL/SSH 
encryption tunnels by using a vnc:// or Vnc:// prefix before
host:display.  Shift+Ctrl-E is a short-cut to add/remove it.
See also the \fB-noenc\fR option below.

Normally you do not specify any command line options.  You simply
run \fBssvnc\fR and use the GUI that starts up.

However, as shortcuts you can supply a VNC host:display (or host:port)
on the command line to connect to immediately (the GUI is started
and the connection is initiated).  For example, "\fBssvnc far-away.east:0\fR"
Instead of a  host:display, you can specify the name of a saved profile to
automatically load that profile and then connect to its server.  
For example "\fBssvnc far\fR", if you named the profile "far".
You can use the \fB-profiles\fR option to list the profiles you have saved.

The related commands \fBsshvnc\fR and \fBtsvnc\fR start up the GUI in
simplified modes: SSH Only Mode, and Terminal Services Mode, respectively.
See below and the application Help for more information on the modes.

There are also some command line options described as follows.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\--help\fR
Starts up the GUI as though the 'Help' button was pressed to show the
main Help panel.
.TP
\fB\-profiles\fR
List the saved SSVNC profiles you have created.  A profile
is a destination host with specific parameter settings.
.TP
\fB\-list\fR
Same as \fB\-profiles\fR
.TP
\fB\-ssh\fR
Start in "SSH Only Mode".  No SSL aspects are shown.
Same as running the command \fBsshvnc\fR
.TP
\fB\-ts\fR
Start in "Terminal Services Mode".  This is like "SSH Only Mode", but
simpler and assumes \fBx11vnc\fR is available on the remote side
to start and manage X and VNC sessions.
Same as running the command \fBtsvnc\fR
.TP
\fB\-tso\fR
Same as \fB-ts\fR "Terminal Services Mode", however never let the
user leave this mode (no button to switch modes is provided.)
Same as SSVNC_TS_ALWAYS=1.
.TP
\fB\-ssl\fR
Force the full GUI Mode: both SSL and SSH.  This is the default.
.TP
\fB\-nv\fR
Toggle the "Verify All Certs" button to be off at startup.
.TP
\fB\-nvb\fR
Never show the "Verify All Certs" button.
Same as SSVNC_NO_VERIFY_ALL_BUTTON=1.
.TP
\fB\-bigger\fR
Make the Profile Selection Dialog window bigger.
Same as SSVNC_BIGGER_DIALOG=1.
.TP
\fB\-noenc\fR
Start off in a mode where a 'No Encryption' check button is present.
You can toggle the mode with Ctrl-E.
Same as SSVNC_DISABLE_ENCRYPTION_BUTTON=1. Or noenc=1 in ~/.ssvncrc.
Selecting no encryption is the same as the vnc:// and Vnc:// prefixes
described below.
.TP
\fB\-killstunnel\fR
On Windows, automatically terminate the STUNNEL process when the viewer
exits instead of prompting you (same as killstunnel=1 in ssvnc_rc or
toggle in Options menu)
.SH URL NOTATION
Here are all of our URL-like prefixes that you can put in front of
host:display (or host:port): 

For SSL:  vncs:// vncssl:// and vnc+ssl://

For SSH:  vncssh:// and vnc+ssh://

For No Encryption:  vnc:// and Vnc://

Examples:

To quickly make an SSL connection: \fBssvnc vncs://snoopy.com:0\fR

To quickly make an SSH connection: \fBssvnc vnc+ssh://fred@snoopy.com:0\fR

To quickly make a direct connection: \fBssvnc Vnc://snoopy.com:0\fR

The above will also work in the "VNC Host:Display" entry box in the GUI.
Press the "Connect" button after entering them.

The difference between vnc:// and Vnc:// is that the latter one will not
prompt you whether you really want to make an unencrypted connection
or not.
.SH FILES
Your SSVNC vnc profiles are stored in the \fB$HOME/.vnc/profiles\fR
directory.  They end in suffix \fB.vnc\fR

Your SSVNC vnc certificates and keys are stored in the \fB$HOME/.vnc/certs\fR
directory.  They typically end in \fB.pem\fR (both certificate and
private key) or \fB.crt\fR (certificate only).

You can put a few global parameters (e.g. mode=sshvnc) in your
\fB$HOME/.ssvncrc\fR file (\fBssvnc_rc\fR on Windows); see the
application Help for more information.
