# tightvncviewer:
#
#    A wrapper that calls the enhanced TightVNC viewer. 
#
# The enhanced TightVNC viewer features are:
#
#	- SSL support for connections using the co-bundled stunnel program.
#	- rfbNewFBSize VNC support (screen resizing)
#	- cursor alphablending with x11vnc at 32bpp
#	- xgrabserver support for fullscreen mode (for old window mgrs)
#
#
# Your platform (e.g. Linux.i686) is autodetected and enhanced
# vncviewer and stunnel binaries for it are used (see the ./bin directory).
#
# See the build.unix script if your platform is not in this package if
# you want to build one.
#
# See the build.unix script if your platform is not in this package if you want to build one.
# You can also set the env. var. UNAME=os.arch to any "os.arch" you want
# to override the autodetetion.
#
# Usage:
#
#     tightvncviewer [tightvncviewer-args] hostname:N 
# or
#     tightvncviewer -ssl hostname:N [tightvncviewer-args]
#
# "hostname:N" is the host and VNC display to connect to, e.g. snoopy:0
#
# If the first argument is "-ssl" then ssl_tightvncviewer is called 
# instead.  See that script for details.
#
# See the TightVNC viewer documentation for on its cmdline arguments.
#
# For convenience, here is the current (7/2006) TightVNC viewer -help output:
#
#       TightVNC viewer version 1.3dev5
#       
#       Usage: vncviewer [<OPTIONS>] [<HOST>][:<DISPLAY#>]
#              vncviewer [<OPTIONS>] [<HOST>][::<PORT#>]
#              vncviewer [<OPTIONS>] -listen [<DISPLAY#>]
#              vncviewer -help
#       
#       <OPTIONS> are standard Xt options, or:

#               -noshared

#               -noraiseonbeep
#               -passwd <PASSWD-FILENAME> (standard VNC authentication)
#               -user <USERNAME> (Unix login authentication)
#               -encodings <ENCODING-LIST> (e.g. "tight copyrect")
#               -bgr233
#               -owncmap
#               -truecolour
#               -depth <DEPTH>
#               -compresslevel <COMPRESS-VALUE> (0..9: 0-fast, 9-best)
#               -quality <JPEG-QUALITY-VALUE> (0..9: 0-low, 9-high)
#               -nojpeg
#               -nocursorshape
#               -x11cursor
#               -autopass
#       
#       Option names may be abbreviated, e.g. -bgr instead of -bgr233.
